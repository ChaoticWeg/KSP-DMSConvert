# DMSConvert

DMSConvert is a small addon for Kerbal Space Program that adds a GUI for
converting from decimal degrees to degrees/minutes/seconds (DMS) format.

Uses for this include:

- Input lat/long into HyperEdit quickly and easily
- (I'm sure there are more, but I'm incredibly tired and have class in the morning)
